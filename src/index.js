/**
 *  Project Brainstorming:
 * 
 *  - projects > todos > task desciptions
 * 
 *  - view/webpages:
 *  - projects tabs
 *  - todos for an individual project
 *  - a space to edit description, due date, and priority
 * 
 *  - Todo object props:
 *  - Title
 *  - Discription
 *  - dueDate
 *  - Priority
 *  - complete? 
 * 
 *  - initally, Project 1 could be a default project, where all todos initally go
 *      - allow the user to change the default?
 * 
 *  - Modulars needed (separate dom and application logic):
 *  - create new todo (logic)
 *  - setting todo as complete (logic)
 *  - changing todo priority (logic)
 *  - changing views (logic? dom)
 *      
 *  - UI Requirments:
 *      - view all projects
 *      - view all todos in a individual project
 *      - expand a todo to see/edit details
 *      - delete a todo
 *      - delete a project ( add safety )
 * 
 *  - UI design:
 *      - Im thinking of having the ui look similar to trello
 *      - Projects view will be a grid of all projects
 *      - individual project view will look like a trello board
